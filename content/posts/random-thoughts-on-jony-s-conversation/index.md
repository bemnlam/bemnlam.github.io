1. Deeply insightful reflection on design, technology, and purpose, drawing from a conversation with Jony Ive.

2. The discussion with Jony Ive highlights a crucial perspective: that design, and indeed creation in technology, should transcend objectives solely "driven by money and power". Ive eloquently articulates a different "north star" rooted in **"foundational values"** and a purpose to **"serve the species"**, striving to **"enable and inspire people"** and even **"sincerely elevate the species"**.

3. Jony's principles are profoundly applicable to our craft, extending beyond physical products to the very nature of how we develop and deliver software. Much like being a **"toolmaker"**, our work is about building solutions designed to move things forward, expressing the **"essence of something and its purpose"** through simplicity, achieved through working **"wonderfully efficiently"**.

4. Jony speaks compellingly about infusing work with love and care. This care, even in the smallest details, allows users to **"sense care"** and feel that "somebody gave a shit about me". It's a way of expressing **"gratitude to the species"**. As developers, we can embody this principle. Every line of code, every commit, is an opportunity to express this care â€“ not just for the end user, but for our colleagues.

5. The principle of **"finishing the inside of products,"** even the unseen parts, serves as a powerful reminder that caring for the underlying structure and cleanliness of our code matters immensely. It's a **"powerful marker of who we truly are"**. This internal discipline is also fundamental to **caring for each other within the team**, fostering trust and demonstrating respect by making our work clear and understandable. It's a way of treating one another as collaborators and humans, not simply as functional components in a process.

6. This conversation has reinforced my belief that our role in technology comes with an **"obligation and a responsibility to care for each other"**. Jony Ive's perspective is truly inspiring, guiding my practice towards building not just functional software, but products crafted with purpose, care, and a genuine commitment to enabling and inspiring others.
