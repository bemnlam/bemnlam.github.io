Cloudflare Account  Add a domain Change your nameservers Verify nameservers   Updating DNS Records  (Application) Load Balancers Amazon SES   Summary     Domain Registrar In my opinion, domain registrar is the most confusing part when you configure Cloudflare. To check the details of your domain, use the Domain Name Registration Data Lookup. Here is the lookup result of gitlab.com:\nThe Registrar Information section contains the information where you should change the nameservers in the next step.\nWhat about AWS Route53? Route53 can be a domain registrar OR just managing the hosted zone. If you see AWS is the Registrar in this lookup, then you should update the config in AWS Route53.\nExample 1: Domain purchased from GoDaddy For example, if you purchased your domain in GoDaddy and having a hosted zone in AWS Route 53 (That\u0026rsquo;s my case), GoDaddy is therefore your domain registrar and you should login GoDaddy\u0026rsquo;s account to change the nameserver, NOT AWS Route 53\nExample 2: Domain purchased from AWS Route 53 Unfortunately, You can purchased a domain in AWS Route 53 too. In this case, AWS Route 53 is your domain registrar.\nYou should change the nameservers in the Route 53 console \u0026gt; Registered Domains.\nWhat about NS Record? Changing a NS Record is not the same as changing a nameserver. From the article DNS NS record:\n The NS record indicates which DNS server is authoritative.\n So, a NS Record is similar to MX Record, CNAME Record, A Record, etc. They are all the items under the domain.\nNameserver of the domain is at a higher level and it\u0026rsquo;s controled by the domain registrar.\nCloudflare Account Add a domain It\u0026rsquo;s free to create a Cloudflare account: https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up. Cloudflare also offer paid plans and I won\u0026rsquo;t discuss them in this article.\nChoose the free plan and then click Continue\nAfter that, Cloudflare will do a DNS scan for the domain you\u0026rsquo;ve entered. Click Continue.\n Note: Not all the recoreds captured are correct. You will need to add/delete/update some of them later.\n Change your nameservers The last step of setup is changing the nameservers. You will see the following instruction:\n1. Log in to your registrar account In the previous section, you should know which service provider is your domain registrar. Login to your domain registrar and find out the nameserver config. Then, remove the existing nameservers (the entries shown in step 1). For example:\nns1.mydomain.com ns2.mydomain.com ns3.mydomain.com ns4.mydomain.com 2. Replace with Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s nameservers: When all the existing nameservers are removed, you have to add the Cloudflare nameservers in the domain registrar. For example:\nautumn.ns.cloudflare.com hans.ns.cloudflare.com Note: you have to enter the 2 nameservers shown in step 2. Other (Cloudflare) nameservers won\u0026rsquo;t work.\nVerify nameservers Again, lookup the domain details using Domain Name Registration Data Lookup. This time you should check the details in the Domain Information section.\nYou should see the nameservers are replaced with the Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s nameservers.\n Note: Changing nameservers is quick and you should be able to see the updated records within 5 minutes.\nOn the other hand, changing the records under this domain may take a longer time (e.g. 24-48 hours).\nDo not mix them up.\n You may click the Done, check nameservers button once you finished changing the nameservers in your domain registrar.\nUpdating DNS Records As mentioned in the above, we have to change some of the records in Cloudflare.\n(Application) Load Balancers You need to replace those A Records into CNAME Records.\nIn AWS Route 53 the load balancer records are in the forms of alias. Cloudflare will fetch the A Records of the load balancers.\nGet the CNAME of your load balancer under AWS EC2 Console \u0026gt; Load balancers \u0026gt; Select your load balancer and see the details. After that, delete the A Record in Cloudflare and add a new CNAME record for your load balancer.\nI used to keep the A Record in Cloudflare and it does work for few days. After that, the IP of that load balancer changed and the website cannot be connected.\nAmazon SES I also found that the SPF and DKIM records for Amazon SES does not created in Cloudflare too. In this case you need to create those records manually in Cloudflare. Just follow the instruction provided by Amazon then you will know how to do:\n  Authenticating Email with SPF in Amazon SES\n  Authenticating Email with DKIM in Amazon SES\n  Summary To use Cloudflare, you need to understand what a domain registrar is. By changing nameservers in a domain registrar and updating some records related to AWS\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure, we can set up the Cloudflare domain for an existing website using AWS Route 53.\nThis is the end of this article (as well as the year 2020).\n","date":"2020-12-31T17:46:38+08:00","desc":"This article shows how to configure Cloudflare for an existing website using AWS Route 53.","permalink":"https://bemnlam.github.io/posts/set-up-cloudflare-for-route53-domains/","tags":["tutorial","cloudflare","aws","route53"],"title":"Set Up Cloudflare for AWS Route 53 Domains"},{"categories":["Dev"],"contents":"Overview This is an guide on how to set up a AWS EC2 free tier with GUI. The EC2 instance will be able to connect via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or SSH.\nYou need to create a AWS account: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup. You may need to provide your credit card information during the signup process.\nSign in to your AWS Account and go to the AWS EC2 Console: https://aws.amazon.com/console/\nTable of Contents  Overview Create an AWS EC2  Set up the security groups Choose the OS, instance type and storage Create and download a .pem key file   Connect to EC2 via SSH Install a GUI and RDP  GUI: LXDE RDP: XRDP Connect to EC2 via remote desktop   Bonus Materials  1.

Use EC2 as a VPN server       Create an AWS EC2 Set up the security groups I suggest you define the security groups before setting up the instance. Setting up the security groups will give you a better understanding on what inbound/outbound traffic is allowed in the instances you are going to create.\nChoose Security Groups at the left menu of your EC2 Dashboard. Create 2 security groups:\n rdp: Allow inbound traffic via port 3389 ssh: Allow inbound traffic via port 22 Allow all outbound traffic  Choose the OS, instance type and storage Choose Services \u0026gt; EC2 from the menu. At the EC2 Dashboard, choose Instances.\nClick the Launch Instance and choose the suitable AMI (Amazon Machine Image). Here I choose a t2.micro instance with Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS image. Remember also choose the suitable Storage as not all kinds of storage are free. In this example I set up a 30GB General Purpose storage.\nAllow SSH and RDP connections Choose the security groups created in the previous step:\nCreate and download a .pem key file You should create this key file. If you don\u0026rsquo;t create this and link it to the instance, you will not be able to connect to the instance via SSH or RDP. Here we create a new key file named ssh_private_key.\nAfter that, click Download Key Pair and keep the key file save.\nDo a chmod on the key file You need to make sure that the ssh_private_key.pem downloaded is able to execute. Run chmod to change the permission:\n‚ùØ ll ~/Downloads/ | grep \u0026#34;ssh_private_key.pem\u0026#34; -rw-r--r--@ 1 BEN staff 1.7K Jul 2 18:41 ssh_private_key.pem ‚ùØ chmod 400 ~/Downloads/ssh_private_key.pem ‚ùØ ll ~/Downloads/ | grep \u0026#34;ssh_private_key.pem\u0026#34; -r--------@ 1 BEN staff 1.7K Jul 2 18:41 ssh_private_key.pem Connect to EC2 via SSH Once you click the Launch instance , you should be able to see your instance in running state in the web console.

It is a tool for continuous integration, deployment, and delivery. I use this tool for all the .NET-based web applications running on the Windows ecosystem.\n Note on 2020: Bitbucket Pipelines is a newer service created by Atlassian. If you are building applications other then Windows, macOS, or iOS applications then I strongly recommend you to use this instead of Bamboo.\n Table of Contents  Deployment (CD)  Glossary   Build (CI)  Glossary   Git   Deployment (CD)  Nuget Packages Websites   Build (CI)  Nuget Packages Websites       CI/CD principles In my opinion, when you start designing your CI/CD workflows:\n Make things predictable. Think of the deployment (CD) first, then work backward to the integration (CI) part. Use Gitflow in your source code.  Fundamentals of Bamboo The menu in Bamboo (version 6.5.0) contains 3 parts:\n Projects, Build and Deploy.  Deployment (CD) Here is a typical deployment project summary looks like:\nYou can check this out by clicking Deploy \u0026gt; All Deployment Projects. After that, choose one of the item on the list.\nGlossary Artifact: The content built in the CI part.\nDeployment Environment: The place the artifacts should go to.\nRelease: A unique (and usually auto-increment) identifier of this deployment.\nDeployment Project: A collection of build plans.\nBuild (CI) Here is a typical build dashboard:\nThis is the default front page of Bamboo. You can also check this out by clicking Build \u0026gt; All Build Plans.\nGlossary Build: The build result of the default plan.\nBuild Plan: Usually it refers to the definitions of all build-related configuratoins. However, sometimes it also refers to the default build barnch or the default branch configurations.\nI will try to avoid using the term build plan in this article as it is a bit confusing. I will use :\n  default branch configuratoins to indicate the default settings of a build plan;\n  default build branch to indicate the branch associated to the default branch configuratoins.\n  When I use the word build plan, it refers to the item listed under Plan column in the build dashboard.\n  Build Project: Similar to Deployment Project, it\u0026rsquo;s a collection of build plans.\nGit From the basic assumption in the CI/CD principles, pt. 3 all the repositories are using Gitflow. I will use the following conventions when talking about the CI settings.\nDefault build branch: git\u0026rsquo;s develop branch.\nBuild branch: All the other git\u0026rsquo;s branches, including feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*, master\nMaster branch: git\u0026rsquo;s master branch\nLinked Repository: Store all the git repository connection setups for later user in CI/CD steps. It\u0026rsquo;s under ‚öôÔ∏è (Bamboo Administration) \u0026gt; Linked repositories.\nLinked repositories\"\nThis is an example for a class library:\nAnd this is an example for website:\nNext, I will talk about how to design a CD flow, then a CI flow.\nDesigning a CI/CD workflow  Assumption: you are using gitflow to manage your git repository.\n In short:\nDeployment\n 1 deoloyment project, many deployment plans. 1 destination, 1 deployment plan.  Integration\n 1 Bitbucket git repository, (usually) 1 Bamboo build plan  build the develop branch using default plan configuration git branch \u0026lt;\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Branch config of a build plan   1 Bitbucket project, 1Bamboo build project  Deployment (CD) All the deployments in my team can be categorized in to 2 types: either a library (i.e. a nuget package) or a website (i.e. an IIS website).\nNuget Packages My team is using MyGet to host private packages. So, there is only 1 destination for my artifact goes.\nThis is how I organize the deployment project:\nDeployment Project ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Production environment: for builds from master ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Pre-release environment: all other branches Websites We have 2 web servers for production and other environments has a corresponding web server. All running IIS. On the other hand, some of the websites are hosting under a sub-directory (as a sub-site).\nTherefore, an artifact may goes to multiple destinations.\nIn my design, 1 deployment environment responsibles for 1 destination (i.e. 1 IIS web server).\nSo you may ask: why not 1 deployment environment for 1 environment? Here\u0026rsquo;s why:\n1-to-1 mapping of deployment environment and IIS website The bad One of the downside is: It takes longer time to deploy all websites. Consider the case of deploying 2 deployment projects at the same time, and each project has multiple deployment environments. The sequence of deployment activities can be:\n deploy site A to environment A deploy site B to environment A deploy site A to environment B (triggered by activity 1.) deploy site B to environment B (triggered by activity 2.)  Which means I have to wait for the deployment of another website.\nThe good The biggest advantage of doing so is that modefying one deployment environment does not affect any settings of the other deployment environments. Then, I can do the following things:\n A/B testing Rollback the version of a specific web server Check out the audit log / deployment history for a particular web server  Moreover, you can see the status of all environments in the All Deployment Projects page (Deploy \u0026gt; All Deployment Projects).\n If deployment of a particular web server is failed, I am able to find out which server is it easily Plus, I can just re-deploy to that particuler web server  You can create a new deployment environment by cloning an existing one (from the same deployment project or from another one). Thus, this is not a tedious task.\n(I am not sure about the above observation and please do let me know if I got something wrong or there are any better solutions.)\nMy decision This is how I organize the deployment project:\nDeployment Project ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Production (A) environment: for builds from master / release ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Production (B) environment: for builds from master / release ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Staging environment: all other branches ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UAT environment: all other branches Build (CI) Similarly, my team has to build nuget packages, .NET Framework and .NET Core web applications.\nIn my case, the CI part has a close relationship with the gitflow.\nNuget Packages I need to build 2 kinds of artifacts:\n Testing package: Prerelease; Production package; Release (used by other solutions/projects in production) deployment.  Plan/Branch configurations (See the Websites section.)\nWebsites I need to build 2-3 kinds of artifacts:\n For UAT environment; For Staging environment (this environment is not 24/7 and will be set up when necessary); For Production environment.  Default configurations: develop For the default settings in a build plan, always choose the develop as the main branch and allow Bamboo to create/remove all the feature/*, hotfix/* branches.\nProduction configurations: master Define a build plan for master branch. Uncheck Clean up plan branch automatically under Branch details tab to prevent this branch being deleted by Bamboo.\nNote on release branches I ususlly not using release branch. When I use that, I will set up a build branch manually, just like the master.\nStaging configurations: staging Just like the set up of production configurations. However, change the variables for the staging environment.\nYou may also need to override the default branch configurations under the Variables tab.\nYou can find these tabs under form the top menu: Build \u0026gt; All build plans \u0026gt; üñã (right end of the plan) \u0026gt; (Choose the plan branch name).\n","date":"2020-09-20T14:45:18+08:00","desc":"Thoughs about using Atlassian Bamboo: the introduction.","permalink":"https://bemnlam.github.io/posts/notes-on-atlassian-bamboo/","tags":["Bamboo","continuous integration","continuous delivery"],"title":"Notes on Atlassian Bamboo"},{"categories":["Dev"],"contents":"This post contains many useful snippets for me when writing Ruby scripts.

Later, I found that dev.to can publish articles (as draft) from a RSS feed. In that way I don\u0026rsquo;t have to copy-and-paste my articles manually in order to publish the same item on dev.to!\nTable of Contents  Background üò® Problem üòÄ Solution  Locating rss.xml Rendering the full content Regenerating the site   Bonus: The difference between {{ and {{- in Hugo Conclusion     üò® Problem Although dev.to\u0026rsquo;s puslishing from RSS feed service is great, my Hugo site is not that great (with the basic settings). When I was trying to sync my RSS feed items to dev.to, all items can be imported but only the beginning part of the content was fetched.\nI know that should be something wrong with the RSS feeds generated by Hugo. The default Hugo RSS template only renders Summary of an article and my Hugo theme is using that:\n As you can see in line 73, the \u0026lt;description\u0026gt; in my RSS feeds contain article summary only but not the full content. Is there any ways to change the Summary here into something else? Something else that represents the full content?\nüòÄ Solution Locating rss.xml Usually, Hugo templates are placed under {your hugo theme}/layouts/_defualt/. If such file does not exist, it\u0026rsquo;s time to create one. You can copy-and-paste the code from Hugo\u0026rsquo;s github or run the following curl command under /layouts/_default to download it:\ncurl \u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gohugoio/hugo/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/_default/rss.xml\u0026#34; \u0026gt; rss.xml Rendering the full content Rendering the full content of is really simple and straight-forward. What you need to do is just replacing this:\n\u0026lt;description\u0026gt;{{ .Summary | html }}\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; With this:\n\u0026lt;description\u0026gt;{{- .Content | html -}}\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt; Caution: use {{- instead of {{. Read the bonus part if you want to know what is the difference.\nRegenerating the site Updating the RSS template will not update your generated content automatically. Therefore, you need to re-generate your Hugo site:\nhugo You should see the changes in all RSS xml files (from git). After that, push all the code changes, remove all the fetched posts in dev.to and re-fetch them. That\u0026rsquo;s it.\nBonus: The difference between {{ and {{- in Hugo You may notice that the template code is changed into {{- from {{. As a newbie in Hugo I checked the Hugo\u0026rsquo;s official documentation about whitespace.\n \u0026hellip; the ability to trim the whitespace from either side of a Go tag \u0026hellip;\n This - notation is introduced in Go 1.6.\nThe following example (from the documentation):\n\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; {{ .Title }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; {{- .Title -}} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Which will output:\n\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; Hello, World! \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;Hello, World!\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; In other words, that\u0026rsquo;s the trim() in JavaScript. That\u0026rsquo;s the String.Trim() in C#.\nConclusion The default RSS feed in Hugo site shows article abstract only. By defining a custom rss.xml template and replacing {{ .Summary | html }} with {{- .Content | html -}} in the \u0026lt;description\u0026gt; tag you will get the article\u0026rsquo;s full content in the re-generated RSS xml files.\n","date":"2020-07-03T09:53:38+08:00","desc":"The default RSS feed in Hugo site shows article abstract only.

I know I should do that but I also know that I will meet the Did you forget to signal async completion? issue which also will cause an epic fail of the build unless I re-write the gulp tasks.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to change my gulpfile.js and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to upgrade gulp. Not now. That\u0026rsquo;s why I started searching for a solution without changing any configurations of the build server as well as the gulp setup in the project.\nüòÄ Solution: adding a npm-shrinkwrap.json Eventually I found a solution on how to handle this \u0026ldquo;Gulp VS Node\u0026rdquo; situation. What we need is create a npm-shrinkwrap.json file under the same directory with package.json.\nThe content of the json file:\n{ \u0026#34;dependencies\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;graceful-fs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4.2.3\u0026#34; } } } After that I can build the project and finish all the gulp tasks without errors üéâ.\nü§î So, what\u0026rsquo;s going on? From the npm\u0026rsquo;s official documentation on the npm-shrinkwrap command:\n This command repurposes package-lock.json into a publishable npm-shrinkwrap.json or simply creates a new one. The file created and updated by this command will then take precedence over any other existing or future package-lock.json files.\n And from the documentation on the npm-shrinkwrap.json:\n \u0026hellip; Additionally, if both package-lock.json and npm-shrinkwrap.json are present in a package root, package-lock.json will be ignored in favor of this file.\n In other words, this file has a higher priority then package-lock.json. However, why this file can solve the build error?\nThefs module Node\u0026rsquo;s fs module got some changes since v11.15 which cause the graceful-fs@^3.0.0 package does not work anymore. Unfortunately, gulp@3.9.1 depends on graceful-fs@^3.0.0. As a result, running the gulp tasks on Node.js v12 will cause the primordials is not defined error.\nThe fix After we added the npm-shrinkwrap.json, from my understanding it locked down the version of package(s) used by the execution environment to the version stated in that file (and ignore the setup in package-lock.json.In the above case, the npm-shrinkwrap.json tells Node.js 12 use graceful-fs@4.2.3 instead of graceful-fs@^3.0.0. This combination works. Meanwhile, the gulp package will still reference to the package.json and package-lock.json file and use the graceful-fs@^3.0.0 package. This combination also works.\nüéØ Conclusion I got some build errors when using gulp@^3.9.0 and gulp-sass under Node.js 12. After I delete the package-lock.json and re-run npm install, the sass problem solved.

This is what I did: https://bemn-proof-of-concept.gitlab.io/mkdoc/.\nTable of Contents  MkDocs  Preparation Up and Run Add a new page Theming Custom Resources   GitLab Pages  .gitlab-ci.yml Build and Deploy   Conclustion   MkDocs {#intro}## From MkDocs' official website:\n MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that\u0026rsquo;s geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.\n In my opinion, setting up a static site using MkDocs is really straightforward. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to change the theme and insert custom styles/scripts. Keep it simple, stupid. That\u0026rsquo;s what I need.\nPreparation Make sure that you have the following tools:\n python 3.x and pip. Install it via executable from the official website, or using tools like Homebrew.  $ python --version Python 3.8.2 $ pip --version pip 20.0.2 from /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8) a GitLab account. You can use other service like Github Pages, Amazon S3, etc. (optional) a markdown cheatsheet.  (For me, the most difficult part is how to get the python and pip versions right. In Mac the built-in python version is 2.7 but we need python 3 to install pip.)\nUp and Run $ pip install mkdocs $ mkdocs --version mkdocs, version 1.1.2 Assuming that your project folder is doc-project:\n$ mkdocs new doc-project $ cd doc-project A MkDocs project is then created with the following folder structure:\ndoc-project ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs ‚îÇ¬†‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ img ‚îÇ¬†‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.ico ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mkdocs.yml Let\u0026rsquo;s run the site:\n$ mkdocs serve INFO - Building documentation... INFO - Cleaning site directory INFO - Documentation built in 1.65 seconds [I 200612 23:30:19 server:334] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000 And check it out at http://127.0.0.1:8000!\nAdd a new page The content Remember, all the documents should place under docs. Let\u0026rsquo;s create an Overview page:\n$ cd docs $ touch overview.md After that, add some content to overview.md.\nThe menu If you want the visitors to reach the overview page, you need to add an url in the menu. Let\u0026rsquo;s edit mkdocs.yml, the site config file:\n# In mkdocs.yml... site_name: Doc Project ## change your site name here. nav: - Home: index.md - Overview: overview.md ## add this line. You will see a new link called Overview in the menu. If you want to set your site name now, change the value of site_name.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s it. That\u0026rsquo;s how to add a new page.\nTheming You can apply a custom theme to MkDocs. This page contains many themes contributed by the community.\nIn this section, I will apply the Material Design theme to my MkDocs site.\nStop running your site and install the theme by:\n$ pip install mkdocs-material Update the mkdocs.yml again:\n# In mkdocs.yml... site_name: Doc Project nav: - Home: index.md - Overview: overview.md ## Add this section theme: name: material palette: ## Add this sub-section if you want to change the theme color scheme: amber primary: amber accent: orange Start the site:\n$ mkdocs serve You will see MkDocs is dressing the amber Material Design theme.\nCustom Resources Sometimes you may want to add custom CSS or JS. In MkDocs, you can do it by adding extra_css and extra_javascript sections in mkdocs.yml.\nI created a catalog page which contains a table written in markdown. Also, I want to apply jQuery DataTables to make the table more interactive. Therefore, I added the related js libraries and related css file to MkDocs. You can see the result here.\nExercice: create a catalog.md file and add a markdown table in it.\nNext, add the custom resource sections to the config file:\n# In mkdocs.yml... site_name: Doc Project nav: - Home: index.md - Catalog: catalog.md ## The catalog page you created in the exercise. theme: name: material palette: scheme: amber primary: amber accent: orange ## Custom js files. extra_javascript: - https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js - https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.21/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js - scripts/site.js ## Custom css files. extra_css: - https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.21/css/jquery.dataTables.min.css Create a custom js file:\n$ cd docs $ mkdir scripts $ cd scripts $ touch site.js Now in your site.js file:\n$(document).ready( function () { $(\u0026#39;table\u0026#39;).DataTable(); }); Afer that, you should be able to see an interactive table in the catalog page.\n GitLab Pages Create a GitLab repository under your personal space or a project group. The url will be something like https://gitlab.com/{username or project group name}/{repo name}.\nClone the repo you created and create the following items:\n$ mkdir src $ touch .gitlab-ci.yml Place your MkDoc items (i.e. the doc-project folder) under src. See the following folder structure:\n(root of the repo) ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitlab-ci.yml ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ doc-project .gitlab-ci.yml The .gitlab-ci.yml is a GitLab-specific file. GitLab will read and run the steps in the file. We need to tell GitLab how to generate and deploy our static MkDocs website. In this file:\n# In .gitlab-ci.yml... image: python:3.8-buster ## MkDocs requies python. pages: stage: deploy ## tell GitLab to deploy the website in this step. before_script: - pip install mkdocs ## install MkDocs. - pip install mkdocs-material ## install the theme. script: - cd ./src/doc-project - mkdocs build ## built the site. - mv site ../../public artifacts: paths: - public ## Uncomment the following section if you want to run this step under master branch only. # only: # - master  So basically it tells GitLab to install the tools required under python 3.8 environment and deploy the website after the site is generated.\nTry to run the following command if you want to generate the site locally:\n$ mkdocs build The generated site is located under doc-project/site/ .\nIn order to display the website properly, you need to place the generated site under the public folder and let GitLab knows the artifact inside is the website you want to deploy.\nBuild and Deploy Push the code to GitLab and the site should build automatically. Check out the status of the build under CI/CD \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Pipelines.\n  A green tag showing passed for each successfully build.   Check out your website now. The url is https://{username or project group name}.gitlab.io/{repo name}/.\n Conclusion In this tutorial, we created a static site with custom theme, styles and js library by using MkDocs. After that, we set up a CI/CD pipeline on GitLab for building and deploying this static site to GitLab Pages.\n","date":"2020-06-12T19:37:00+08:00","desc":"A guide to build a static website using MkDocs and deploy it to GitLab Pages.","permalink":"https://bemnlam.github.io/posts/documentation-makes-easy-with-mkdocs-and-gitlab-pages/","tags":["tutorial","python","mkdocs","markdown","gitlab"],"title":"Documentation Makes Easy With MkDocs and GitLab Pages"},{"categories":["Dev"],"contents":"Background Recently our team started a new project: a showcase page under our main website. The website is read-only and the content won\u0026rsquo;t change frequently so we can have an aggressive caching policy.\nI built this MVC web app using .NET Core 3.1 and deploy it as an IIS sub-site under the main website (which is a .NET Framework web app running on the IIS).\nTable of Contents  Redis  NuGet package appsettings.json Startup.cs CacheService Controller   Cache Tag Helper  Example Explaination   Bonus: A note on @helper and other HTML helpers   Redis Why? We are using Redis because it is simple, fast and we are already using it across all the main websites.\nHow? Here are some highlights:\n1. NuGet packages \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;StackExchange.Redis\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;2.1.30\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;StackExchange.Redis.Extensions.Core\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;6.1.7\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;StackExchange.Redis.Extensions.Newtonsoft\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;6.1.7\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;StackExchange.Redis.Extensions.AspNetCore\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;6.1.7\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; StackExchange.Redis.Extensions.Newtonsoft is optional. Start from .NET Core 3.0 the default Json serializer will be System.Text.Json. If you want to use Newtonsoft.Json then you will need this package in your project.\nStackExchange.Redis.Extensions.Core and StackExchange.Redis.Extensions.AspNetCore are the useful package to connect/read/write Redis easier. Read this documentation for more details.\n2. appsettings.json A typical .NET Core project should have an appsettings.json. Add the following section:\n{ \u0026#34;Redis\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;AllowAdmin\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;Ssl\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;ConnectTimeout\u0026#34;: 6000, \u0026#34;ConnectRetry\u0026#34;: 2, \u0026#34;Database\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;Hosts\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Host\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-secret-redis-host.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Port\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;6379\u0026#34; } ] } } Here, my-secret-redis-host.com is the Redis host and We are using the database no. 0. You can set multiple hosts. You can see a detailed configuration here.\n3. Startup.cs Add the following code in ConfigureServices()\nvar redisConfiguration = Configuration.GetSection(\u0026#34;Redis\u0026#34;).Get\u0026lt;RedisConfiguration\u0026gt;(); services.AddStackExchangeRedisExtensions\u0026lt;NewtonsoftSerializer\u0026gt;(redisConfiguration); 5. CacheService I created a CacheService.cs to help me reading/writing data in Redis. In this service:\npublic CacheService(RedisConfiguration redisConfiguration, ILogger\u0026lt;RedisCacheConnectionPoolManager\u0026gt; poolLogger) { try { var connectionPoolManager = new RedisCacheConnectionPoolManager(redisConfiguration, poolLogger); _redisClient = new RedisCacheClient(connectionPoolManager, serializer, redisConfiguration); } catch(Exception ex) { /* something wrong when connection to Redis servers. */ } _cacheDuration = 300; // cache period in seconds } We need a method to write data:\npublic async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; AddAsync(string key, object value) { try { bool added = await _redisClient.GetDbFromConfiguration().AddAsync(key, value, DateTimeOffset.Now.AddSeconds(_cacheDuration)); return added; } catch (Exception ex) { /* something wrong when writing data to Redis */ return false; } } And we need a method to get cached data:\npublic async Task\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; TryGetAsync\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(string key) { try { if(await _redisClient.GetDbFromConfiguration().ExistsAsync(key)) { return await _redisClient.GetDbFromConfiguration().GetAsync\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(key); } else { return default; } } catch(Exception ex) { /* something wrong when writing data to Redis */ return default; } } I intentionally name this method TryGetAsync() because the cache may not exist or already expired when you try to get it from Redis.\nAfter that, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to Startup.cs and register this service in ConfigureService():\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;CacheService\u0026gt;(); Remember to register this service after services.AddStackExchangeRedisExtensions().\n5. Controller Inject the CacheService to the controller:\npublic DemoController(CacheService cacheService) { _cacheService = cacheService; } public async Task\u0026lt;IActionResult\u0026gt; Demo(string name) { var cacheKey = $\u0026#34;DemoApp:{name}\u0026#34;; // Try to get cached value from Redis.  string cachedResult = await _cacheService.TryGetAsync\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(cacheKey); if(default != cachedResult) { return View(cachedResult); } // Add a new entry to Redis before returning the message.  var message = $\u0026#34;Hello, {name}\u0026#34;; if(null != sections \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sections.Any()) { await _cacheService.AddAsync(cacheKey, message); } return View(message); }  Explain Like I\u0026rsquo;m Five:\nYou ask the shopkeeper in Demo bookstore do they have a specific book name. First, the shopkeeper looks for the book on the bookshelf named Redis. If he finds that book, he takes it out and gives it to you.\nIf your book does not exist in the Redis bookstore, he has to go out and buy that book for you(!). However, he buys 2 identical copies. He gives you one and puts the other one on the Redis bookshelf, just in case another customer want that book later.\n  Cache Tag Helper The Cache Tag Helper is a tag that you can use in a .NET Core MVC app. Content encolsed by this \u0026lt;cache\u0026gt; tag will be cached in the internal cache provider.\nExample \u0026lt;cache expires-after=\u0026#34;@TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60)\u0026#34; vary-by-route=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; vary-by-user=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34;\u0026gt; @System.DateTime.Now \u0026lt;/cache\u0026gt; Explaination In the above example, some attributes is set in the \u0026lt;cache\u0026gt; tag:\n expires-after: how long (in seconds) will this cache last for. vary-by-route: different copy will be cached when the route has a different value in the nameparam. vary-by-user: different user will see different cached copies.  How can I know if it is working? You will see the value rendered in the above example won\u0026rsquo;t change for 60 seconds even System.DateTime.Now should show the current time.\n Bonus: A note on @helper and other HTML helpers In the old days we can define some @helper functions in the razor view and (re)use it in the view. It\u0026rsquo;s being removed since .NET Core 3.0 because the design of @helper function does not compatible with async Razor content anymore.\nSuccessor of the HTML helpers? You can use the Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core. Yes, the \u0026lt;cache\u0026gt; Tag Helper is one of the built-in Tag Helpers in .NET Core.\nIn addition, you can use the PartialAsync() method to render the partial HTML markup asynchronously.\n@await Html.PartialAsync(\u0026#34;_PartialName\u0026#34;)  More references on the HTML helpers and Tag Helpers:\nWhat happened to the @helper directive in Razor ?\nRemove the @helper directive from Razor\nASP.NET Core 1.0: Goodbye HTML helpers and hello TagHelpers!\n","date":"2020-06-11T21:06:59+08:00","desc":"A note on how to add Redis and the cache helper to a .NET core Mvc app.","permalink":"https://bemnlam.github.io/posts/a-tale-of-two-caches-redis-and-cache-helper/","tags":["tutorial","csharp",".NET Core","cache","redis","tag-helpers"],"title":"A Tale of Two Caches: Redis and the cache helper"},{"categories":["Coffee"],"contents":"Background In short: I found some local shops which selling pretty good beans.

They stands for Secure Socket Layer and Transport Layer Security. They are the protocol names.\nWhat is HTTPS, and why we are using it? Https[ecure], a protocol on top of HTTP to secure the integrity of the data sending form the user to server.\nWhat is a certificate, and what is it for? A certificate 1 (.crt, .cer) certifies the ownership of a public key. A certificate contains:\n organization, issuer (e.g. the Certificate Authority / Self-signed), valid period, url, state / country  These information can be used to identify the certificate owner.\nThe public key is used to encrypt/decrypt the communication between computers.\n Cryptography Asymmetric VS. Symmetric Asymmetric cryptography requies a pair of keys. The Public key is used to encrypt messages while the private key is for decryption.\nIn symmetric cryptography, both ends use the same password to encrypt + decrypt messages.\nWhy are we using both technologies? And how? In short: For the balance of security and speed, we use asymmetric cryptography to establish secure connection (handshake) and use symmetric cryptography for the data transmission.\nThe Handshake The end user and the server use the same password to encrypt + decrypt the messages. This password is sent from a server to a user by following steps:\n Validate the certificate\u0026hellip;  User makes a request to a web server. Web server responds with its public key certificate. User checks if the public key certificate is valid.   If the certificate from web server is valid\u0026hellip;  User encrypts the password using server\u0026rsquo;s public key, and send to web server. Server decrypts with its private key.    After that, a secure connection is established and they shared the same password 2.\n Types of certificate Self-signed  Intra-communications between systems under same organization. Local development  CA  Subdomain: tied to 1 domain (e.g. www.mydoma.in) Wildcard: tied to a groups of subdomains (e.g. *.mydoma.in) Multi-domain: (e.g. mydoma.in, myweb.site, \u0026hellip;)   ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) To configuring Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt\u0026rsquo;s ACME on server, we can make use of the CertBot. For IIS, use Certify.\n  HSTS This can instruct the browser to interact with the server with HTTPS only. Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS is not required. This is achieved by adding a response header (Strict-Transport-Security).\nExample response header:\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload What HSTS is protecting us from? The Man-in-the-Middle TLS Protocol Downgrade Attack.3 In this example, the hacker C sends a ARP cache table request to both the client A and server B: Now the traffic from A to B is going through C, a typical Man-in-the-Middle attack.\nThe next step is C try to have a downgrade on the TLS version. Since the browsers are backward-compatible on older TLS versions, C can therefore to make the version downgraded to the negotiated version in the handshake process. C can then intercept and decrypt the messages by making use of the security vulnerabilities of eariler TLS.\nHSTS Preloading Avoid redirection of the first request too: https://hstspreload.org/\n  the certificate does not depends on the protocol we use \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n password is just for the same browsing session. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n I am not an expert on this area and I tried by best to digest that article and this wiki to write the summary. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":"2020-05-23T17:10:25+08:00","desc":"This is a note about the Linkedin learning course SSL Certificates for Web Developers.","permalink":"https://bemnlam.github.io/posts/a-note-on-ssl/","tags":["ssl","cryptography","https","security","linkedin-digest"],"title":"A Note on SSL Certificate"},{"categories":["Coffee"],"contents":"A note on how to brew coffee.\nV60 ‚òïÔ∏è How to Brew V60 with UK Brewers Cup Champion, Sang Ho Park | Comprehensive Guide\n  ‚òïÔ∏è A Coffee Brewing Theory \u0026ldquo;4:6 method\u0026rdquo; Invented by Tetsu Kasuya_ World Brewers Cup 2016 Champion\n  ","date":"2020-05-17T21:10:25+08:00","desc":"A note on how to brew coffee","permalink":"https://bemnlam.github.io/posts/brewing-coffee/","tags":["coffee","v60"],"title":"‚òïÔ∏è Brewing Coffee"},{"categories":["Readings"],"contents":"üéØ Summary As a human being, managing our energy is more important because this is a limited resources.\nWe may wrongly think that increasing working hours can do more. However, longer working hours leads more unfocus time and brings negative effect to your work.\nSurprisingly, having a monthly plan is better then a detailed daily plan. The later one demotivated people because we face inevitable distractions daily.\nüí° Thoughts  Stay focus on work by taking regular breaks. (e.g Pomodoro Technique) In the article, top 10% productive employees work 52-mins work and take 17-mins break. Regularly schedule some time for work individually without distraction.  ‚≠êÔ∏è Highlights  A workplace study found an average working professional experiences 87 interruptions per day, making it difficult to remain productive and focused for a full day.\n  Surprisingly, the top 10 percent of employees with the highest productivity didn‚Äôt put in longer hours than anyone else ‚Äì often they didn\u0026rsquo;t even work eight-hour days. Instead, the key to their productivity was that for every 52 minutes of focused work, they took a 17-minute break.\n  ‚ÄúAt any given point, I should have deep work scheduled for roughly the next month. Once on the calendar, I protect this time like I would a doctor‚Äôs appointment or important meeting,‚Äù\n  While the researchers assumed that the well-structured daily plans would be most effective when it came to the execution of tasks, they were wrong: the detailed daily plans demotivated students. Harford argues that inevitable distractions often render the daily to-do list ineffective, while leaving room for improvisation in such a list can reap the best results.\n üîó reference: Why You Should Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time\n","date":"2020-05-17T13:33:52+08:00","desc":"As a human being, **managing our energy is more important** because this is a limited resources.","permalink":"https://bemnlam.github.io/posts/why-you-should-manage-your-energy-not-your-time/","tags":["self management","work","pocket-digest"],"title":"Why You Should Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time"},{"categories":["Readings"],"contents":"üéØ Summary Â•ΩÂ§öÊôÇÂÄôÈõ£‰ª•ÂèñÊç®ÁöÑÈÅ∏ÊìáÊú¨Ë∫´Â∞çËá™Ë∫´ÊâÄÂ∏∂‰æÜÁöÑÂ∑ÆÁï∞Ê≤íÊúâÊÉ≥ÂÉè‰∏≠ÁöÑÂö¥Èáç„ÄÇÂõ†ÁÇ∫Ê±∫Á≠ñÂõ∞Èõ£ËÄå‰∏çÂÅöÊ±∫Á≠ñÂèçËÄåÊúÉ‰ª§Ëá™Â∑±ÊêçÂ§±Êõ¥Â§ß„ÄÇ\nüí° Thoughts ÊñáÁ´†ÁöÑÁ∏ΩÁµêÊèêÂá∫‰∫ÜÈù¢Â∞çÈÅ∏ÊìáÂõ∞Èõ£ÁöÑÂÖ∂‰∏≠‰∏ÄÂÄãËß£Ê±∫ÊñπÂêëÔºö‰ª•ÂæåÊÇî/ÈÅ∫ÊÜæÂéªÂÅöÊ±∫ÂÆöÁöÑËÄÉÊÖÆ„ÄÇ\n Âú®ÈÅøÂÖçÂæåÊÇîÁöÑÂü∫Á§é‰∏äÂÑ™Âåñ‰Ω†ÁöÑÊ±∫ÂÆöÔºåËÄå‰∏çÊòØÂü∫ÊñºÊàêÂäü/Â§±ÊïóÊàñÂø´Ê®Ç/ÁóõËã¶ÂÅöÂá∫ÈáçÂ§ßÊ±∫ÂÆö„ÄÇ\n  Áï∂‰Ω†Âü∫Êñº‰∏ÄÊ¢ùËÆì‰Ω†ÊúÄ‰∏çÊúÉÂæåÊÇîÁöÑË∑ØÂæë‰æÜÂÑ™Âåñ‰Ω†ÁöÑÁîüÊ¥ªÊôÇÔºå‰Ω†ÂèØ‰ª•Ë®≠ÊÉ≥Êú™‰æÜÁöÑËá™Â∑±ËôïÊñº‰∏ÄÂÄãÊ®°Êì¨Êú™‰æÜÁãÄÊÖãÔºå‰∏¶Ë©¶ËëóÊÑüÂèó‰Ω†ÂèØËÉΩÂ∞áÁ∂ìÊ≠∑Âì™‰∫õÈÅ∫ÊÜæ\n ‚≠êÔ∏è Highlights  ÂÖ©ÂÄãÈÅ∏È†ÖÁöÑÂê∏ÂºïÂäõË∂äÁõ∏‰ººÔºåÂú®‰∫åËÄÖ‰πãÈñìÂÅöÂá∫ÈÅ∏ÊìáÁöÑÈõ£Â∫¶Ë∂äÂ§ß‚Äî‚ÄîÂÑòÁÆ°Âú®ÂêåÊ®£Á®ãÂ∫¶‰∏äÔºåÈÄôÂÄãÈÅ∏ÊìáÊú¨Ë∫´‰∏¶‰∏çÊòØÂ§™ÈáçË¶Å„ÄÇ\n  ‰ΩõÈõ∑Âæ∑ÈáëÊÇñË´ñÊåáÂá∫:„ÄåÂú®ÂøÖÈ†àÂÅöÂá∫ÈÅ∏ÊìáÁöÑÊÉÖÊ≥Å‰∏ãÔºåÈö®ËëóÂÖ©Á®ÆÈÅ∏ÊìáÁöÑÊïàÊûúË∂ä‰æÜË∂äÊé•ËøëÔºåÊ±∫Á≠ñÂ∞±ÊúÉËÆäÂæóÊõ¥Âä†Âõ∞Èõ£Ôºå‰ΩÜÁµêÊûúÂ∞±Êõ¥Ê≤íÈÇ£È∫ºÈáçË¶Å‰∫Ü„ÄÇ„Äç\n üîó Reference:  ‰ΩõÈõ∑Âæ∑ÈáëÊÇñË´ñÔºöÁÇ∫‰ªÄÈ∫ºÊàëÂÄëÁ∏ΩÊµ™Ë≤ªÊôÇÈñìÂú®ÁÑ°ÈóúÁ∑äË¶ÅÁöÑÊ±∫ÂÆö‰∏äÔºü  ","date":"2020-05-17T12:41:12+08:00","desc":"Â•ΩÂ§öÊôÇÂÄôÈõ£‰ª•ÂèñÊç®ÁöÑÈÅ∏ÊìáÊú¨Ë∫´Â∞çËá™Ë∫´ÊâÄÂ∏∂‰æÜÁöÑÂ∑ÆÁï∞Ê≤íÊúâÊÉ≥ÂÉè‰∏≠ÁöÑÂö¥Èáç„ÄÇÂõ†ÁÇ∫Ê±∫Á≠ñÂõ∞Èõ£ËÄå‰∏çÂÅöÊ±∫Á≠ñÂèçËÄåÊúÉ‰ª§Ëá™Â∑±ÊêçÂ§±Êõ¥Â§ß„ÄÇ","permalink":"https://bemnlam.github.io/posts/fredkins-paradox/","tags":["‰ΩõÈõ∑Âæ∑ÈáëÊÇñË´ñ","Fredkin's paradox","ÈÅ∏ÊìáÂõ∞Èõ£","pocket-digest"],"title":"‰ΩõÈõ∑Âæ∑ÈáëÊÇñË´ñ Fredkin‚Äôs paradox"},{"categories":["Dev"],"contents":"This post showing how to create a user with limited privileges in PostgreSQL.\nSituation I created a web app. It reads data from a PostgreSQL database.
