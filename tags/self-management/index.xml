        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-summary&#34;&gt;üéØ Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a human being, &lt;strong&gt;managing our energy is more important&lt;/strong&gt; because this is a limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may wrongly think that increasing working hours can do more. However, longer working hours leads more &lt;strong&gt;unfocus&lt;/strong&gt; time and brings negative effect to your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, having a monthly plan is better then a detailed daily plan. The later one demotivated people because we face &lt;strong&gt;inevitable distractions&lt;/strong&gt; daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-thoughts&#34;&gt;üí° Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay focus on work by taking regular breaks. (e.g &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&#34;&gt;Pomodoro Technique&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the article, top 10% productive employees &lt;strong&gt;work 52-mins work and take 17-mins break&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularly schedule some time for work individually without distraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;--highlights&#34;&gt;‚≠êÔ∏è  Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A workplace study found an average working professional experiences 87 interruptions per day, making it difficult to remain productive and focused for a full day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the top 10 percent of employees with the highest productivity didn‚Äôt put in longer hours than anyone else ‚Äì often they didn&amp;rsquo;t even work eight-hour days. Instead, the key to their productivity was that for every 52 minutes of focused work, they took a 17-minute break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAt any given point, I should have deep work scheduled for roughly the next month. Once on the calendar, I protect this time like I would a doctor‚Äôs appointment or important meeting,‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the researchers assumed that the well-structured daily plans would be most effective when it came to the execution of tasks, they were wrong: the detailed daily plans demotivated students. Harford argues that inevitable distractions often render the daily to-do list ineffective, while leaving room for improvisation in such a list can reap the best results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
