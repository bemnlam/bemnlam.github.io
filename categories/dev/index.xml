Code Let say the user you want to create is webapp_user:
CREATE USER webapp_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD &amp;#39;secure_passw0rd&amp;#39;; Grant the right to all public tables:
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO webapp_user; Connect the database using webapp_user in the web app.</description>
