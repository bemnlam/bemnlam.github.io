      <description>Background In short: I found some local shops which selling pretty good beans. In Hong Kong.
During the 2020 pandamic, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to buy beans overseas. However, it gave me a great opportunity to search for some good beans in Hong Kong. Plus, I have more time to stay at home and brew coffee as the company started the WFH policy from Feb.
